# Web Development Project 4 - *Veni Vici!*

Submitted by: **Sebastian Stec**

This web app: **Calls an API that retrieves images of dogs and attributes related to the dog in the image, such as height, weight, breed, etc.. The user can click on the "Find a new dog!" button to call the API again, which will randomly choose a new image of a dog, along with its attributes. The user can also click on one of the attributes to ban it, which will prevent the API from retrieving an image with the banned attribute. There is also a history section below the ban list, which shows which dogs have been called by the API already.**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total
